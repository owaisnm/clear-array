The objective of this project is to implement a clear array function that clears an array using its indices and another clear array function that clear an array using its pointers. Then, the assembly code for the source file containing the function implementations has to be generated and optimized manually to get time performance improvements. The time performance data of the unoptimized clear array code and the optimized clear array code that uses indices and pointers has to then be plotted to visualize the improvement.
